Hello, I just bought the Z5C (low price on Amazon, less than 200€), and unlocking bootloader to install LineageOS fails ("FAILED - Remote - Command did not succeed" on the fastboot command).

As I understand, only Sony Xperia phones have official AOSP support, ie. official complete fully-tested build instructions with periodical updates (if that's not the case, please tell me!): https://developer.sony.com/develop/open-devices/guides/aosp-build-instructions/ Do the Xperia AOSP builds include anything proprietary that's not mandatory ie. closed source apps etc. (not drivers)? Nexus and Pixel phones seem not to have official support, but have reliable support and unofficial guides. Note that there is also a Xperia Z2 Tablet driver on this website as well as the Sony Xperia ZL2 driver which is listed on this website. The driver below is for the Xperia Z2 mobile phone. I'm not really sure about this new "15.1 daily, 14.1 monthly" update scheme. When I first read news about this update schedule change, I immediately didn't understand nor really like the decision. It's not like the Oreo builds are just freshly coming out and there are lots of bugs to be fixed. Changelogs are being emptier and emptier every week, both because there are less bugs to be fixed, and also because (I believe) developers focused their attention to LOS 16.0 based on Pie.
